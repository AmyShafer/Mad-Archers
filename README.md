# Mad Archer's Cookbook 

Mad Archer's Cookbook helps a hungry public by allowing users to search for recipes by entering in ingredients they already have on hand. 

In the event a user needs more groceries to make the recipe they have been inspired by, Mad Archer's Cookbook supplies the user with a map to search for nearby grocery stores.

### Possible-improvements

In the future, the team would like to allow users to search by dietary restrictions such as vegan or gluten-free.

A second goal for improvement would be making the local storage function more helpful by having the saved items be past selected recipes that the user could reselect quickly.

It would also be practical if users could search for more than one ingredient at one time.
